# python_youtube_coverter
This python script helps in saving the youtube video on your local machine in 720p

Pretty easy to run:
1. Install the pytube library using the command 'pip3 install pytube'.
2. Run the Script.

Note: if you come across the SSL error, I have mentioned some steps to remidiate that for a MacBook. You'd have to look it up for Windows
